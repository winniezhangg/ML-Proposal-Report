<h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction / Background</h2>
<p>
    Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial sector, leading to substantial financial losses. Fraudulent activities, such as card cloning, identity theft, and unauthorized transactions are common challenges for credit card companies. To combat this, many institutions use machine learning to detect unusual transaction patterns and flag potential fraud.
</p>

<h3>Past Cases / Literature Review</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Maniraj et al.</strong>: At SRM Institute, assistant professor S.P. Maniraj built a very similar model to what we are aiming to do. His teamâ€™s model was able to successfully identify new transactions as fraudulent or not with an accuracy of 99.7% [1].</li>
    <li><strong>Safa and Ganga</strong>: They created a model that heavily utilized logistic regression to analyze distorted credit card data. The logistic regression method had a 99.07% accuracy [2].</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dataset Description</h3>
<p>
    We plan to use publicly available datasets like the <strong>Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset</strong>, which contains real credit card transactions with fraudulent transactions. This dataset contains transactions from September 2013 by Europeans. This data is spanned over 2 days, where there are 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions [3]. There are only numerical input variables such as time between the first transaction and current transaction.

<h2>2. Problem Definition</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
    The challenge is to detect fraudulent transactions using both supervised methods (classification) and unsupervised methods (anomaly detection) to identify patterns that indicate fraud.
</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
    The motivation behind creating a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud stems from the desire to protect consumers and financial institutions from significant financial losses. As online transactions and digital payments increase, so does the risk of fraud. This offers a more adaptive approach, learning from patterns in transactional data to detect suspicious activity in real-time, reducing false positives, and enhancing security without compromising user experience.
</p>

<h2>3. Methods</h2>

<h3>Preprocessing</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Check for missing values and adjust the data accordingly, identify and remove any outliers that may be skewing the data.</li>
    <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> Normalization to ensure everything is on the same scale.</li>
    <li><strong>Converting Categorical Values:</strong> Convert categorical features into numerical columns, make sure to label numerical features where order matters.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Logistic regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting Classifiers for detecting fraud based on labeled data.</li>
    <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Use clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, assuming fraud transactions are rare events.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Results and Discussion</h2>

<h3>Metrics</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Accuracy & Precision:</strong> The total amount of transactions that are correctly classified as fraudulent/legitimate should be &gt;80%.</li>
    <li><strong>Recall:</strong> The percent of fraudulent transactions the model is actually able to identify greater than &gt;80%.</li>
    <li><strong>F1-Score:</strong> A metric that measures the models accuracy by utilizing precision and recall and &gt;80%.</li>
    <li><strong>False Positive Rate (FPR):</strong> The percent of falsely classified transactions as fraudulent is less than &lt;1%.</li>
    <li><strong>AUC-ROC Curve:</strong> A metric to measure the model's ability to identify fraud versus non-fraud should be greater than &gt;0.7.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<p>
    Improve fraud detection rate while minimizing false positives, hold people accountable ethically/morally for their actions, and promote the use of credit cards as models like these tend to make their use more safe and sustainable for consumers.
</p>

<h3>Expected Results</h3>
<p>
    The expected results of a machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud should include high accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. The model should be able to flag suspicious activity with precision and effectively distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions based on learned patterns. Additionally, it should adapt over time as new fraud techniques emerge, providing real-time detection and contributing to overall improved security for both users and financial institutions.
